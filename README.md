# channel-content
Scripts, subtitle files and assets for the channel's video content.
## Closed Captions and Translations
All videos will have closed captions in English to be inclusive of deaf and hard-of-hearing audience. People with auditory processing disorders, neurodivergent folks and those with English as a second language also benefit (see "Curb Effect").

Since most people with Laikas live in northern Europe (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Lithuania etc), central Europe or eastern Europe (Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Russia etc) and northern Asia (Mongolia, Kazakhistan, Sakha etc), we apperciate receiving any translations.
